### Challenge
```
In the field of energy advice, conventional methods of assessing energy efficiency are time-consuming, require specialists, and are often inaccessible to many homeowners. Legal requirements are unclear, renovation costs are non-transparent, and information on subsidies is hard to find. This results in frustration, inefficiency, missed savings, and low user engagement.

How might we use LLMs and domain-specific knowledge to build a tailored energy advisor that delivers personalized energy consulting (e.g. including costs, funding) based on user-provided building information â€“ so that we can help users identify and implement energy-saving measures?
